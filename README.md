# personal-portfolio

This README will walk us through my journey to build my personal webiste in EmberJS.

This will be the frontend system that will hold our personal website but its built in EmberJS.

#### How will this project come together

We will be using github's commit history to show how we will build the website from the beginning to the complete project.
Each commit/commit's will break down each step of the process.

Seeing as this is just the frontend means that we will need an api backend to host out content.

**Why do we need a api backend?**

Something needs to hold out blog posts, something that will document our process as we walk through this journey together.
