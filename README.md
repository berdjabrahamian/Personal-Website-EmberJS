# personal-portfolio

This project will be my journey into building out my personal portfolio webiste using the **Ember Js** framework. With each progression, I will be documenting every step of the way from setting up, getting up and running and actually building out the project.

There is a [live demo](https://ba-personal.firebaseapp.com) of the site that will be updated with each new commit and push, that will document in lessons this journey.
